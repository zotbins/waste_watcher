# Introduction
I wanted a way to keep track of how much waste I was generating just to be more environmentally conscious. So I created this project as an automated way to help keep track of waste accumulation through fullness measurements while also taking pictures of the objects thrown away.

# ZotBins Community Edition

This is the first step of a multi-part project of creating a smart waste ecosystem called [ZotBins](https://zotbins.github.io), which is already deployed at UCI. Currently, I am helping to further expand the concept of ZotBins where any city, business, university, classroom, or home could implement a smart waste system. This open-source version ZotBins is called  ZotBins Community Edition (ZBCE). To learn more about this initiative please visit the [ZotBins Community Edition Blog](https://zotbins.github.io/zbceblog/about/)

# Quick Start
Please follow the appropriate build guide for the waste watcher version of your choosing.
- [Waste Watcher Guide](https://github.com/zotbins/waste_watcher/blob/main/v0/guide.md)
    - Measures bin fullness and collects waste images
    - Saves data and images locally
    - Syncs with NTP Client to generate UTC datetime stamps
